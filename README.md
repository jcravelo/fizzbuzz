# I maked this exercise in a interview
# Fizz buzz is a word/math game.
# Count incrementally from 1 to 100, replacing any number divisible by 3 with the word "fizz",
#   any number divisible by 5 with the word "buzz", 
#   and any number divisible by both 3 & 5 with the word "fizzbuzz".
# Example:
#   1
#   2
#   fizz
#   4
#   buzz
#   â€¦
# Write a simple program that prints out the numbers or words from 1 to 100.
